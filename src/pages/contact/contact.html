    <h1 class = "contact_h1"> Usage </h1>
    <p>Tap the List tab to view coffee shops near you. A coffee shop with a 
        <ion-icon [ngStyle]="{'color': 'green'}"  name="radio-button-on"></ion-icon>
      icon is less than 20% full. Go! Coffee shops that are between 20% and 80% full are indicated with 
        <ion-icon [ngStyle]="{'color': 'orange'}"  name="radio-button-on"></ion-icon>,
      while really busy cafes that are over 80% full are indicated with 
        <ion-icon [ngStyle]="{'color': 'red'}"  name="radio-button-on"></ion-icon>.
    </p>
    <p>This app is only as good as you make it. We rely on your user input to provide our users with the most up-to-date information on coffee shop occupancy. When you are in a cafe, tap on the cafe's name in the list tab. Then, simply move the slider to the percentage that you think the coffee shop is full, tap submit, and our sophisticated algorithm will do the rest!</p>
